        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a transitioning US Air Force Special Warfare Veteran, with an active Top-Secret clearance. Currently enrolled in the Washington Vets to Tech (WaV2T) program, specializing in Cloud Application Development, with an anticipated completion date in August 2024. This program grants 18 college credits toward a bachelor's degree in computer science. My studies encompass programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML5, SQL, C#, and familiarity with the Linux OS.

            Actively seeking career opportunities in the domains of Drone Technology, Robotics, Computer Vision, Autonomy, and Cloud Engineering. Bringing a solution-focused mindset, exceptional leadership acumen, and a collaborative approach to teamwork, I am eager to find a company that fosters continuous growth where I can proudly contribute and learn over the long term. The ability to work in small teams to complete a common goal, meet deadlines, problem-solve in stressful and demanding environments, aptitude to learn and adapt to innovative technologies with technical competence. A focus on clear and concise communication, maintaining high standards, and teamwork have led me to success during my service in the US Air Force Special Warfare community.
